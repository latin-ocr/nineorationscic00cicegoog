court over which the praetor Quintus Cicero, the brother of the orator,
presided. Cicero proved that his client was in the strictest sense a
Roman citizen, as the three conditions specified in the law had all been
fultilled: he had been enrolled as a citizen of Heraclea, as was proved
by the testimony of her citizens and of Lucullus, though the archives of
the town could not be produced in proof, as they had been destroyed by
fire3 he resided in ltaly when the law was enacted; and he presented
his name within the prescribed time to the praetor, 'as the record of the
transaction itself showed.

Having thus completed the directly argumentative portion of the
defense, the orator proceeded in the second place to set forth the praises
of poetry and letters, to enlarge upon the value of a life devoted to
polite and learned pursuits‚ and thus to show that the presence of Ar·
chias in Rome was a* public blessing, aud that, even if he were not
already a citizen, it would be the best and wisest course for the state to
confer the franchise' upon him, rather than lose the society and services
of so valuable a man and so gifted a poet.

For the modern scholar this beautiful oration possesses a peculiar
interest from the just appreciation which it shows of the pleasures and
advantages of a cultured aud literary life. The defense was undoubt-
edly successful, as we subsequently hear of Archias as still resident at
Rome.
