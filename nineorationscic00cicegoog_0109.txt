L. SERGIUS CATILINE, against whom this oration was delivered,
belonged to a patrician family which had become greatly impoverished.
He was, therefore, the heir to a noble name, but to no large estates.
Unprincipled and reckless, he early perverted to the basest uses the
remarkable powers of body and mind with which he had been endowed
by nature. As a zealous partisan of Sulla, he acted a conspicuous part
in the bloody proscriptions which followed the triumph of the dictator.

Catiline held the office of praetor in the year 68 13.c.‚ was governor
of Africa in 67, and returned to Rome in 66 to canvass for the consul-

of bribery, was disqualified for entering upon the duties of the consulship
to which he had been elected. The planos the conspirators was to
murder the consuls ou the first of Jauuary‚ during the ceremonies of
inauguratiom after which Catiline and Autronius were to seize the con-
sular power. and Piso was to take possession of the Spanish provinces.
The execution of the plan was, however, subsequently deferred to the
fifth of February. when it was fortunately frustrated by a mistake on
the part of Catiline, who gave the signal before his accomplices were
ready for action.

ln June, 64 B.c., Catiline resumed his revolutionary schemes on a
larger scale and with renewed energy. Rome at that time furnished
him abundant materials for such awork in the throngs of luxurious
ἱ spendthrifts, desperate insolvents, and reclrless adventorem, who filled
her streets. He soon numbered among his accomplices eleven senators,
