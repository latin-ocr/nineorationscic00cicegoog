Exordium, 1 ·

Paga 207, line 1. Cmmnn 1.-Diutumi silentii . . . dicendi: note
carefnlly the arrangement of this important introductory sentence. The first
two words diuturni silentii revealed the thought nppermost in the mind of
Cicero at the moment—his longcoutinued silence. Emphasis therefore places
them at the beginning of the sentence, while dicendi in contrast with them
stands at the end of it. Cicero’s silence had continued more than five years.
He lest Rome in the year 51 B.C. with the title of proconsul to take charge of
the province of Cilicia In the Civil war he espoused the cause of Pompey3
but, after the disastrous battle of Pharsalus, he returned to Italy, where he was
finally pardoned by Caesar in the year 47 uc. He took no part, however, in
the discussions of the senate until the magnanimity of Caesar in pardoning his
friend Marcellus called forth the present oration.
