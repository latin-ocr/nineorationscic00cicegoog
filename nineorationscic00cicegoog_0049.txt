was worthy to be canonized as a saint, but for the single
drawback that he was not a Christian. The language of
Petrarch is scarcely less emphatic. He says you would
sometimes fancy it was not a pagan philosopher but a
Christian apostle who was speaking. Whatever we may
think oi the extravagant encomiums bestowed upon our
author by his chief admirers, and oi the equally extrava-
gant abuse to which he has been subjected by his most
unreasonable detractors, we must all, I think, recognize in
him the sincere patriot, the upright magistrate, and the
true man. No more eloquent or earnest advocate ever
pleaded the cause of right and of liberty, at the bar or in the
Forum. His contributions to letters and to human thought
excite our admiration and wonder, alike by their extent
and by their excellence. He not only created a language
which ior centuries continued to be the language ol
scholars throughout the civilized world, buthe alsoen-
riched it with those treasures ot literature which have fur-
nished models to succeeding generations. Conceive, ii you
can, what a void would have been made in the best litera-
ture οἱ the world, if all the works oi Cicero had perished
in the general destruction which overtook so many of
them. Well, then, may we endeavor to estimate at its true
value, and with due appreciation‚ the priceless heritage
which has come down to us through the centuries from
the quiet study of Marcus Cicero.
