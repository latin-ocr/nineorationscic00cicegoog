Aristotle were his great teachers and nrodels He had a
great admiration for Greek philosophy; he regarded itas
the knowledge of things human and divine, the guide oi
life and the mother oi all good deeds. It was his laudable
ambition to bring within the reach of his follow-citizens
the rich treasures of Greek learning and Greek thought,
which had been to him a source alike of joy and oi
strength. He tells us that all he hoped to do was to clothe
Plato in a Latin dress and to present this stranger from
over the scas with the freedom of his own cherished city¹
All this he has accomplished and more. He has left a
popular treatise on philosophy for the students of all time.

49. De Officiis-The treatise De Officz'zr, on the com-
mon duties of life, was addressed by Cicero to his son,
then astudentof philosophy at Athens. A recent Eng-
lish writer declares this t'o be “the noblest present ever
made by a father to his son.'' It discusses subjects ol
scarcely less interest to the modern scholar than to the
ancient philosopher, and the moral tone of the entire dis-
cussion is surprisingly high. The author tells us that
there is no condition in life without its duties and obliga·
tions; that the faithful discharge oi these duties gives the
highest nobility, and that the neglect oi thern is at once a
crime and a disgrace; that we are born, not for ourselves
only, but for our kindred, neighborS, and country; and
that we owe duties not only to' those who have done us
lavors, but even to those who have wronged us. “The Ἴ
noblest inheritance,'’ he tells us, “that a father can ever
leave to his son, infinitely more valuable than that oi
houses and landS, is the farne of his virtues and glorious
deedS, and no sadder iate can befall a noble house than

to be disgraced by a degenerate son.’'
