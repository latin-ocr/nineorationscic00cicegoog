urbem vigiliae haberentur iisque minores nzagr'slratus praeessent.

timor : Sallust, Cat. 31, gives a vivid description of this timor populi.

5. bonorum: referring probably to the loyal citizens who surrounded the
senate.

6. ora vultusque: ora, referring to the scaturentia face,· vultus, to tlte
expression osthe sace, the looks. The looks of surprise and indignation with
which the senate received Catiline as he took his seat are here meant.

7. non sentis: this form of question shows greater passion than that with
nonne. H. 378,1; LM. 6973 A. 332, a ; G.453; B. 162, 2,d; (H. 351, 3).

9. proxima, superiore nocte : last night, the night befhre. The dates were

November seventh and sixth respectively. The events referred to are not
entirely clear. On the night of November sixth, a meeting of the conspirators
was heldat the house of Laeca, where Catiline explained his plans and set
forth the necessity of putting Cicero out of the way; cf. Sall. Cat. 27. The
following night may have been the time for the attempt on Cicero’s life, but
a comparison of all the passages referring to this matter seems to indicate

, that this attempt was made early in the morning of November seventh. Some

movement otherwise unknown may be referred to here.

10. quos convocaveris: the names of the chief conspirators are found in
Sall. Cat. 17.

quid consilii: H. 4413 LM. 5643 A. 346, a, 3, G. 369³ B. 201, 2 ;

of each. Immo, noy more, strengthening the previous statement, which con·
tains only a part of the truth.

in senatum : as an err-praetor, Catiline was of course a senator.

3. publici consilii particeps: Catiline, notwithstanding the leading part
he had taken in the conspiracy, had the effrontery to take his seat in the
senate. Sallust, Cal. 31, gives his reasons for attending as follows: Postrema
dissimulandi causa aut sui expurgandi in'senatum venit.
