LIFE OF CICERO 15

crimes of the defendant in such dark and threatening
colorS, that Hortensius who was at the head of the Roman
bar and had been retained for the defense, threw up the
case in despair, and his client went into voluntary exile.
The frve books which embody the material collected for
this trial form the severest indictment ever brought against
aRoman governor‚- an indictment whose only parallel
in modern times must be sought in the impeachment of
Warren Hastings.

15· Cicero’s success in conductihg this important trial
and the publication of his masterly pleas placed him at
the head of the Roman bar, the position which Hortensius,
whom Cicero calls “the king of the court5‚’' had long held.

16. Cicero as curule Aedile—The office of curule
aedile, to which Cicero was elected while engaged in the
prosecution o'f Verres, was ordinarily a very expensive
one. The candidate for popular favor was expected to
entertain the people with public festivities and costly
amusementS, but Cicero with rare good sense continued
to devote himself to the real welfare of the republic with-
out attempting any ostentatious display or incurring any
extravagant expenditure. .

17. Cicero as Praetor. -After the usual interval of two
years Cicero was returned at the head of the list of prae-
tors. ·Fortune now seemed to smile upon our candidate
for political honors. There was only one higher office in
the gift of the people‚ and his eye was already lixed upon
that, but he knew that the best recommendation for future
honors was the conscientious discharge of present duties.
He accordingly gave his personal attention and his best
thought to the judicial functions of his high office( No
dishonest decisions ever received his sanction.
