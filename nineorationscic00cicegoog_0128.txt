INTRODUCTION

Tun effect of the oration which we have just read was perfectly elec-
trical. Catiline was lor the moment paralyzed, but, quicldy recovering
his sels-possession and assuming the tone of injured innocence, he im-
plored the senate not to trust the base slanders which the consul had
heaped upon him3 he even ventured upon harsh and abusive language
against Cicero, but his voice was at once drowned with cries of “En-
emy,'' ‘⁴ Traitor‚” from the whole assembly. That night he lest the city.

On the following day, the ninth ol November, Cicero delivered his
Second Oratr'on against Cutiliae before the people in the Forum.l His
’ object was to justily the course which he had pursued in relation to the
conspiracy, to allay the general excitement, and to intimidate the con-
spirators who had not yet left the city.

ln the meantime, Catillne had repaired to the camp of Manlius, and
had assumed the fasces and other insignia of consular power. The
senate accordingly declared him an outlaw, ordered new levies of troopS,
and dispatched able leaders to different parts of the country where dan-
ger was apprehendcd. Cicero was directed to guard the city, and
Antonius was appointed to the command of the army destined against
Catiline.
