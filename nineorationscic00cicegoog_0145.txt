lNTRODUCTlON

Acconnnvo to the plan which Catiline unfolded to his associates
before his departure, il we can trust Cicero, Cethegus was to assassin-
ate the consul, the praetor Lentulus was charged with the general man-
agement os the affairs of the conspiracy in the capital, Cassius was
to set tire to the city, and, in the midst os the general confusion
attendant upon the conflagration, the conspirators were to open com-
munication with Catiline. But, while the execution of the bloody plot
was delayed, a deputation srom the Allobroges in Gaul visited Rome to
present certain complaints against the provincial government. Lentu·
lus, taking advantage of their disaffection, endeavored to interest them
in the conspiracy, but Cicero finally succeeded in securing their coo'p·
eration, and encouraged them to continue their negotiations with the
conspirators, and obtain lrorn them a written statement os the propo-
sition which they were to make to their people. The experiment was
perfectly successful. The required statement was readily obtained. The
Gallie ambassadors‚ having finished their work, lelt Rome on the night of
the second of December, accompanied by Titus Volturcius, the bearer of
dispatches for Catiline, but they had proceeded only a short distance
beyond the city gate when they tell into the hands os an armed force
in the employ of the govemment. Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, and
Gabinius were arrested the next morning. Later in the day the pris·
oners were all brought before the bar of the senate. The evidence of
their guilt‚ in the opinion of Cicero, was overwhelming, aud was finally
confirmed by their own confessions.

Alter the adjoumment of the senate, Cicero addressed the people¹
on the great events ol the day in his Third Oration against Catilina.
