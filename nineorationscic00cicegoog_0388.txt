Ν 122 NOTES

(quaestiones perpetuae) established by Sulla. The iudices at this time were
drawn from the senators, the equites, and the tribuni aerarii ,· see 143.

quod sentio . . . exiguum: and I perceive how small it is ,· quod is the
subject of sit. The unusual modesty of Cicero in this introduction is only
apparent. He wishes to stand well with his jury.

2. qua: a common form for quae after si.

3. huiusce rei: ie. dicendi.

4. ab proiecta: derived stom.

optimarum artium : i.e. especially philosophy, grammar, rhetoric, and poetry.

aqua: from which, i.e. from the study or pursuit of it; qua refers to
ratione.

5. abhorruisse: has been averse. Cicero was ever a diligent student.
During the busiest periods of his life he devoted his leisure hours to reading
and study.

6. earum rerum: ie. the three requisites named above.

A. Licinius: i.e. A. Licinius Archias. When Archias became a Roman
citizen under the patronage of Lucullus, he took, as was customary, the gen·
tile name of his patron. Why he selected the praenomen Aulus we do not
know. By using his Roman name Cicero assumes at the outset that Archias
isa citizen.

fructum a me . . . debet: Cicero thinks that his teacher, Archias, is fairly
entitled to share the fruit of the instructions which he had imparted to him
in his youth.

7. repetere: to demand in return.

prope suo iure: os alnrost ais own by rigia· prope is added, as suo iure
without such qualification would be too strong.

quoad longissime . . . respicere: assor os my mind can possibly look back
ovem· quoad longissime is a rare phrase not elsewhere found in Cicero.

Pege 191, line 1.- ultimam: the earliest. Note the emphatic position.

inde usque repetens: recalling even from that period,· inde usque,
another rare phrase. Archias came to Rome when Cicero was only five years
of age.

2. hunc mihi principem exstitisse: that he was my guida

3. rationen horum studiorum: this course of study.

4. hortatu: not elsewhere found in Cicero’s orations3 no other case of
this word occurs in Cicer0.

conformata: trained

5. nonnullis saluti: H. 4333 LM. 5473 A 382, ¹3 G. 3563 Β. 191, 23
