103. The quaestorship is supposed to have existed under
the monarchy. Under the early republic two quaestors
were appointed by the consuls to act as their general
assistantS, but with two specific duties‚ criminal jurisdiction
and finance.· About the year 449 ise. the quaestorship
became an independent elective office, and from that time
the quaestors were elected by the comitia tributa, and
became regular magistrates ol Rome.

104. llumber of Quaestors. —The number of quaestors,
originally two, was increased to four in the year 421 Bc.
and to eight in 267.¹ Ol the four quaestors elected aiter
421 rac. two were 'retained in the city in the discharge of
their judicial and financial duties, and two were assigned
to the consuls in the field. Their duties were mainly
financial, but they were often employed in judicial and
military business. The city quaestors continued to dis·
charge their judicial duties until the establishment οἷ’ the
regular courts by Sulla.2 The four new quaestors elected
in 267 sc. were assigned to duty in different parts ol
Italy, to levy contingents on the allies‚ andin general to
look after the interests of the government. -

105. Rank of Quaestor.— In rank the quaestorship was
the lowest of the regular magistracies of Rome; it was not
a curule office, and was not vested with the imperium,
but it was finally made a steppingstone to the senate, as
under Sulla all eir-quaestors were ex officio members ol the
senate.

1Subsequently Sulla increased the number to twenty, aud finally Caesar
increased it to sorty.
