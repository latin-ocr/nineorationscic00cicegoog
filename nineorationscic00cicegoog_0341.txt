natus erat, says Sall. Cat. 51.

22. haec: i.e. hanc urbem, spoken with comprehensive gesture.

conati sunt: why not subjunctive?

23. C. Caesaris: Gaius Julius Caesar, than praetor-elect, afterward dic· ,,
tator. His speech, as reported by Sallust, Cat. 51, should be read at this
point.

Observe the asyndeton.

8. Itaque eam . . . inventa sunt: note the irony in this passage3 these
are Cicero’s words, adopting Caesar's recommendation and carrying it out to
its final issue to show how great severity it really involves. Bear in mind that
Cicero himself favors the death penalty proposed by Silanus; hence he here
artfully seeks to prove that imprisonment for life is after all the severer penalty
of the two.

the Stoice, who professed to regard death with perfect indifference.
