14. Gabinio . . . anne: shall I say ta Gabinius ar,· dicentis a delibera·
tive subjunctive.

15. ne legaretur . . . Pompeio: that A. Gabinius might nat bc appointed
legatus to Cn. Pompey. According to a Roman law, the lex Licinia et Aebutia,
no one could receive an appointment under a statute proposed by himself.
Hence Gabinius could not be legally appointed a legatio under the Gabinian
law. For this reason, Pompey, who had been given the right to appoint his
legali, had not ventured to appoint Gabinius, but he finally asked the senate to
do so. This demand, however, as Cicero tells us, had been vigorously opposed.

16. Utrum ille, an ipse: a direct double question.

22. periculo: at 'his peril. Dion Cassius tells us that the senate was so
enraged at Gabinius for forcing his law through the assembly that his life was
in danger.

23· Falcidius, Metellus, etc: these are mentioned, not because they were
men of note, but simply because they had served as lieutenants the year after
they had been tribunes of the people. ‘she objection, however, to the appoint·
ment of Gabinius as lieutenant to Pompey in the war against the pirates was
not that he had just been tribune of the people, but that he was himself the
author of the law under which alone such appointment could be made.
Cicero here, as osten, wishes, by bringing in a new issue, to turn attention
away from the weakness of his position.
