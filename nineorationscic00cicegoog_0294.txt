quae . . . est carior: this relative clause is merely explanatory and not
closely connected with the main clause, hence it has the indicative.

22. evocatorem servorumr Catiline, though urged by Lentulus to enlist
slaves (Sall. Cat. 44), refused on the ground that, hy making common cause
with them, he would lose the favor ol the citizens, Sall. Cot. 56.

24 immissus in urbem ι because he may be expected to return to the
city with an armed force.

hunc duci: depending on imperabis. Cicero uses the infinitive with
impero only in the passive. The common construction is an object clause
with the subjunctive.

26. Hosne maiorum: the country personified proceeds to consider the
three excuses which the consul might urge lor not putting Catiline to death:

quae rogatae sunt: which have been ennetea'. Legem rogare may mean
either to propere or to enac! a law. Rogo was regularly used in putting the
question on the passage ol a law.

2. At numquam : the answer to this second excuse: those who have with·
