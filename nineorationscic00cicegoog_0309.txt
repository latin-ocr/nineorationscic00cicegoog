SECOND ORATION AGAINST CATILINE 1139

si interfectus esset, dicerent: note caresully the 10100 01 the tenses in
this condition. ’

23. dictitant: are continually saying. Observe the force 01 the frequen·
tative form. H. 364³ LM. 953 A. 263, 2; G. 191, 1; B. 155, 23 (H. 336).

24. hoc: this, i.e. that Catiline is on his way to Marseilles.

queruntur qnam verentur: thepcomplaint that Catiline had been unjustly
driven into exile is mere pretense. Their real feeling is that 01 joy at his de·
parture, as they believe that he is on his way to the camp 01 Manlius, and yet
they have some little sear that he may, aster all, abandon his revolutionary
schemes and go into exile. Hence their real feeling is not so much that 01
dissatissaction as 01 sear.

istorum: os those fellows.

25. tam misericors: so compassionum, 1.0. so much interested in the wel·
sare 01 Catiline. Ι1 they were really interested in his welsare, they would pre-
fer that he should go to Marseilles, where he would be sale, rather than that
he should court certain destruction by joining Manlius.

qui non malit: ut is non malit, as not to prefer. H. 591, 2; LM. 836;
Α· 5371 23 G· 63i,1; B.284‚2; (H‘500)·

ad Massiliensem: Massiliam, the citizens 101 the city, perhaps to bring ι

the expression into harmony with ad Manlium.

27. latrocinantem: as a brigand.

se interfici mallet: cf. Cupio mc esse clementem, p. 89, l. 10. The com·
plementary infinitive is also common with ntalo.

30. nisi quod: except that.

vivis nobis: while we are alive, ablative absolute; but nobis may 10101
10 Cicero alone.

optemus: let tls desire ,· because, 11 he does not go into exile, he will surely
make war upon his country.

Observe that the second sentence in this chapter contains a good example
01 a latin period, 1111110 si . . . dicetur. The meaning 01 the sentence is
held in suspense till the last word isuttered, and in this case it is uncertain
what the mood 01 the verbs in the protasis is till dicetur is reached. See
11. 085; LM.1165; A. 601; G.684‚687; B. 351, 5³ (H·573)·

Study caresully the moods in the relative clauses in this chapter.

Pag0114,line 1. eninm 8.—Sed: Cicero proceeds in the next place
to speak 01 the partisans and followers 01 Catiline who have not yet lest the
city. He divides them into six classes.

2. fatetur se esse hostem: it is here assumed that Catiline has gone to
the camp 01 Manlius.
