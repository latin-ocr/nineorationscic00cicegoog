country's enemy. I defended the commonwealth when Ι
was young 3 Ι will not desert it now Ι am old. I despised

fathers, death can never be untimely to one who has been
the consul of this great republic; to me it is almost an
object to be desired‚ in view of the honors Ι have enjoyed Ι

Roman people free; the immortal gods can grant me no
greater boon than this; the other that each of my fellow-
citizens may receive from the state the reward which his
conduct deserves.’'

37. Cicero continues his Philippica-For the next lew
months Cicero continued to hurl his Philippics one after
another' against the tyram, declaring him to be a public
enemy and calling upon the senate and the Roman people
to assert and maintain their liberty at all cost. The fol-
lowing sentences are from the closing paragraph of the
sixth Philippic‚ delivered before the people in the Forum

when the gods above have willed us to be the masters of
the world, is a crime in the sight of heaven. The final

You must conquer‚ Romans or die, rather than be slaves,
Other nations may bear the yoke of slavery‚ but the birth-
right of the people of Rome is liberty.'’
