123. Influence in Military Affairs. — All diplomatic nego·

tiations with foreign nations were conducted by the senate,
but it never possessed the absolute right to declare war.
It had, however, quite an important influence in the man-
agement oi military affairs. It exercised the right to ap-
propriate money, to provide reenforcements, and to grant
or refuse a triumph. Moreover, no treaty of peace was
valid without the consent of the senate.

124. Influence with Magistrates.-The assignment ot
provinces to err-magistrates also belonged to the senatorial
prerogative. This recognized right ol the senate gave that
body great influence with the consuls and praetorS, as they
could hope to secure valuable provinces only through its
lavor.

125. Influence in Financial Asmira—The public reve-
nues were largely under the control ol the senate; the
quaestors usually acted under the advice of that body of
state counselurs; the estimate of revenue and expendi-
ture made by the censors was supervised by it; and the
linancial budget‚ containing the appropriations made to
the several provincial governors‚ was voted by it.

126. Influence in Religious Affairs.- The pontufex maxi-
mus, assisted by his college of priests, was the recognized
head ol the Roman religion, and had the general oversight
ol the ordinary religious duties and rites3 but in times ol
public alarm, in view of remarkable prodigies supposed to
indicate the displeasure of the gods, the senate cooperated
with the priestly colleges. It sometimes decreed extraor-
dinary religious festivals and often appointed public thanks·
givings for military successes
