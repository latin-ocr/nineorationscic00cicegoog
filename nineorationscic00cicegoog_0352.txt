secure his cooperation, and received in return the province of Cisalpine Gaul,
which he afterward resigned.

21. pro triumpho: i.e. the triumph which he might have secured as pro·
consul of Macedonia.

²3· pro clientelis hospitiisque: in placeas the clientships and guest-
friendslcips. As proconsul, Cicero would have had an opportunity of estab-
lishing friendly relations with prominent citizens in his province. Eveu
towns· und cities often made the proconsul their patron. For the relation
between client and patron, see 77.

24. quse: relations which,· quae, though referring grammatically to
clientelis hospitiisque, refers logically to the connections which he had
actually made, and not to those which he might have made as proconsul.
Thus Cicero was patron of the Sicilians, and, as such, conducted in their
behalf the important prosecution against Verres. Τὴε efforts which he made
to retain these relations show how highly he prizes them, though for his coun-
try's sake he cheerfully waived the privilege of forming new ones.

At the close of this oration Cicero resumed his duties as presiding officer,
and Marcus Porcius Cato, on being asked his opinion, declared that the great

and pressing duty of the senate was to provide for the safety of the republic‚
and that that safety required the prompt execution of the prisoners. For the
speech itself, see Sall. Cat. 52, who says it closed as follows:-

Ego ita censeo .· cuno nesorio consilia sceleratorum civium respublica in
maxima pericula venerit, iique.. . convicti confessique sint, caedem, incendia
aliaque se foeda atquc crudelia facinora in cives patriamque paravisse, de
