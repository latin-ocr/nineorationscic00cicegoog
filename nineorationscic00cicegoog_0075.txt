and at the end of that period he nominated a second inter-
rex, and thus one interrex succeeded another until a king
was nominated. The nomination thus made required the
approval of the comitia curznta andos the senate. Under
“ the republican interregnum occurred on the death oi the
two consuls, and the procedure for the nomination of their
successors was the same as that which was adopted in the
- case of an interregnum in the regal period. The election‚
however, took place, not in the comitia crerintn, but in the
comitia centuriata under the presidency of the interrex,
and was approved by the patrician senators.

PRAEFEcrus URBI

112. Under the early republic, whenever both consuls
were summoned to the field, they delegated full consular
powers to an officer called praefectus urbi, to act for them
in their absence; but after 366 nc. the praetor rtrbnnns
assumed consular duties in the absence of the consuls.

. MIerARY TRIBUNES

113. In the army of the early republic six military trib-
unes, tribnni militurn, were assigned to each legion. They
were appointed by the consuls, but after 362 nc. some
were elected by the comitia tributu, at first six, but finally
twenty-four, the requisite number for the usual levy of
four legions. It at any time the number thus elected did
not suffice, additional appointments were made by the
consuls.
