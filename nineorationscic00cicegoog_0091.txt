PLACES OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO THE STUDENT OF CICERO¹

145. The Forum, Comitium, Curia, the Temples ol Con-
cord and ol Jupiter Stator, the Tullianum, and the basilicas
are somewhat closely connected with the public lile of
Cicero.

146. Forum—The Roman Forum was originally a low
open valley between the Palatine, Capitoline, and Quirinal

Hills. It early became a market-place, with booths and
stalls on its northern and southern sides, It was a little

more than five hundred feet in length and about one hun-
dred and fifty in width. In the course ol centuries the
rude stalls of the regal period, the tabernae veteres, gave
place to better structures, and on the north side appeared
the tabernae argentariae, occupied largely by goldsmiths
and other skilled artisanS, and finally temples and other
stately edifices were erected in its immediate vicinity. At
the close of the regal period it had already become an
important place of business The Capitolium, the famous
temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus or Jupiter Capitolinus,
the national sanctuary of the ancient Romans, crowned one
of the neighboring heights of the Capitoline Hill. The
cella consisted of three parts, of which the central was dedi·
cated to Jupiter, the left to Juno, and the right to Minerva.
The temple ol Jupiter Stator probably occupied a declivity
of the Palatine at a short distance to the east ol the F orum.
