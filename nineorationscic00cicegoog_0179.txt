undertaking. City after city threw open its gates and welcomed the
victor as a deliverer from the Roman yoke. Elated by these early suc-
cesseS, he issued an order almost unparalleled in cruelty, for a general
massacre of Roman citizens in Asia, an order which was executed with
relentless severity. Eighty thousand Romans, without distinction of
age or sex, were ruthlessly massacred. At this junctnre the great Sulla
was sent against him. The victories won by this famous general and
by Fimbria, who succeeded him after murdering the consul Flaccus, led,
in 84 B.c., to a treaty of peace. A second Mithridatic war, unwisely
instigated by Murena whom Sulla had lest as propraetor of Asia, was

soon brought to a close through the influence of Sulla, 81 B.c., and for '

the next six years Mithridates was nominally at peace with the Romans,
but in 75 lac. he invaded Bithynia, which led to the renewal of hostili-
ties. ln 74 uc. Lucullus was appointed commander of the Roman
armies in Asia. For seven years he prosecuted the war with great vigor
and success3 he conquered Mithridates, took the greater part of PontuS,
invaded Armenia, defeated Tigranes and took the Armenian capital;
but this brilliant career of conquest was finally checked by the disaffec·
tion of his soldiers. Accordingly, in the year 67 B.c., he was super-
seded by Glabrio, who proved to be a very inefficient commander.
Mithridates and Tigranes promptly availed themselves ol the oppor-
tunity thus offered them of recovering the territory and power which
they had lost. lt was at this crisis in the Roman affairs in the East,
that the tribune Gaius Manilius, in the spring os 66 B.c., moved that
Pompey, who had just achieved such signal success in the war against
the pirates, and who was still in Asia at the head of a large and victori-
ous army, should be intrusted with the chief command in the war
against Mithridates and Tigranes. The bill, generally known as the
Manilian law, proposed to clothe Pompey with almost unlimited power,
and accordingly met with violent opposition hom Catulus and Horten·
sius, on the ground that it would be perilous to the best interests of the
republic to place such extraordinary powers in the hands of any one
man. lt was, however, warmly advocated by Caesar and Cicero, and
was carried by acclamation lt was on this occasion that Cicero pro·
nouuced his oration for the Manilian law.

Pompey, on receiving this appointment‚ hastened to encounter Mith-
ridates, over whom he soon gained a signal victory. The vanquished
king barely escaped with his life, and, unable to find shelter in Armenia,
