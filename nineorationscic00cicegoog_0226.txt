INTRODUCTION

MAchs Cnnunrns Mnucstnns belonged to the ancient 3ηά illus·
trious Claudian gens, which had produced a long line of distinguished
statesmen and generals. Hc was the intimate friend of Cicero, was an
orator of some repnte, was consul in the year 51 13.c., and, while in

oration, eulogizing in the strongest terms the magnanimity of the Dicta-

mercy.

the rights of Roman citizenship, could no longer refuse to comply with
