four members of the equestrian order, and several men of position and
influence in the provincial towns. Thus strengthened, he boldly pre-
sented himself asa candidate ior the consulship, but defeat awaited him.
Marcus Cicero the orator and Gaius Antonius were elected consuls, the
former hyan overwhelming majority. This was a severe disappoint-
ment ior Catiline, but it only rendered him more reckless than ever in
his revolutionary designs. His audacity aimed at nothing less than the
overthrow of the government.

It was at such a crisis as this, that on the first of January in that
memorable year, 63 nc, Cicero, the accomplished orator and scholar,
entered upon the arduous and perilous duties of the consulship, but he
proved himself equal to the emergency. He secured the passive co·

that place. On the night of the sixth oi November, Catiline met the
most prominent of his partisans at the house oi Marcus Laeca. He
announced his purpose to join the army at the earliest possible date,
assigned to the leaders their several parts in the work of the conspiracy,
and urged upon them the importance ol taking the life oi Cicero. Two
