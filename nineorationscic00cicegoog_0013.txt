of the interest now taken in historical and¹ political questions
both in school and in college.

The notes and the vocabulary are the product oi the joint
labors oi the three editors whose names stand on the title-page.
For the introductions and the illustrations the senior editor
alone is responsible.

My thanks are due to Harper δι Company lor permission to
use the illustration oi the Tumulus oi Achilles from the “Ilios ” oi
Dr. Schhemann, and to Houghton‚ Mifflin & Company and The
Macmillan Company for the use oi illustrations from Lanciani’s
“Ancient Rome '' and Kelsey's edition oi Mau’s “Pompeii'’
and to E. Becchetti of Rome lor the use of his valuable draw-
ings oi the Restoration of the Forum and its Surroundings.

My thanks are also due to Professor J. H. Dickason oi
Wooster, Ohio‚ for his kindness in reading the prooi and in
making valuable suggestions.

In conclusion I desire once more to convey my sincere
thanlrs to the classical teachers oi the country, who by their
fidelity and skill in the use of my previous books have con-
tributed so largely to their success. To their hands this volume
is now respectiully and gratefully committed.
