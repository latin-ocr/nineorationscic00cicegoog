tablets and deposited in the treasury, aerarium, in care of the quaestores:

7. interfectum esse convenit: convenit is perfect, and the construction
is parallel with oportet in similar connections; convenit, however, refers rather
to the propriety of the act than to the need of it. The present infinitiveis
more common in such a connection; cf. duci cpoliebat, p. 88, l. 7, but the
perfect emphasizes the conrplction of the action. Translate and by the terms
asthis decree, Catiline, you ought to hove been a deod man ot once. H. 620, 25
ch486, b, N.; G. 280, 2, κ. 23 B. 270, 2, o; (H. 537, 2).

10. Cupio, cupio: note the anaphora of the verb aud the omission of the
coniunctiori autem or vero. The second statement is really adversative.

patres conscripti: the senators were originally called patres, fathers,¹
afterward patres conscripti, conscript fathers, i.e. fathers enrolled on the
lists of the senate. The common explanation, that the phrase was at first
potres et conscripti, the latter word referring to the new members added when
the republic was established, is of doubtful authority. Cicero once uses the
singular form, poter conscreptus.

12. dissolutum: remiss, nearly synonymous with neglegens, hut stronger.

13. me inertiae: H.456; LM. 5823 A. 3523 G. 378; B.208 ; (H.4o9, 11).

inertiae nequitiaeque: synonyms, of which the latter is the stronger.

14. Caetra : this was the camp of Manlius at Faesulae in northern Etruria, the
headquarters of the conspiracy. The choice of Faesulae was wisc, as it gave
easy communication with Cisalpine Gaul, and was one of the colonies occupied
by the restless veterans of Sulla who favored Catiline's plans; see Map of Italy.

in ltalia: in Italy, emphatic, not in a foreign land, hut near home.

15. indies singulos: from dayto day ,· distinguish from cotidie,l. 18, every day.

16. imperatorem ducemque . . . moenia: ie. the commender-inehief
and actual leader (not Manlius, hut Catiline) is not so far away as Faesulae
even, but right here among us.

17. atque adeo: andeoen.

18. molientem: H. 613, 43 LM. 1019; A. 497,d; G. 536; B. 337, 33
(H. 535, Ι, 4). We see Catiline actually at his work.

19. iussero: future perfect because the future action denoted by it must
precede the future action denoted hy erit verendum. Notice that the Latin
is much more exact than the English in the use of tenses.

creden erit verendum: J shall nave to sear, I suppose, — not tlrat att good
citizens will say I love acted too slorolyc — lut tter soore one will say enat J aare
acted witto excessioe cruelty. The thought is that he has reason to fear the
charge of slackness rather than of cruelty. Credo is ironical and parenthetical,
not affecting the construction of erit verendum.
