These new text-books are the crowning triumph oi a lile-work which
has made the name ol their author familiar to classical scholars and
teachers everywhere. They represent the latest advances in philological
seleuce, and embody the results ol the audror's large experience in
teaching and oi his own linguistic studies, together with the suggestions
and advice of eminent German specialists in the field of Histori'cal and
Comparative Grammar.x T he peculiar qualities oi simplicity‚ clearness,
and adaptation ol treatment to the practical needs ol the student and ol
the class mom-qualities that have always characterized the Harkness
Grammars,—have been preserved and even intensified in these new books.

1 The Complete Latin Grammar is designed at once as a text-book
for the class room and a book ol reference for the student. It aims not
only to present systematically for the benefit of the beginner the lead-
ing facts and laws oi the Latin language, but also to provide accurately

for the needs oi the advanced student.
The Short Latin Grammar is published lor the benefit ol those who

prefer to begin witha more elementary manual, or those who do not
contemplate a collegiate course. ln the preparation of this work the
convenience and interest ol the student have been carelully consulted.
The parading‚ mles and discussions have in general been introduced
in the exact form and language‘ol the Complete Latin Grammar by
which it may at any time be supplemented. The numbering os the
sections in the two books is also alilre.
