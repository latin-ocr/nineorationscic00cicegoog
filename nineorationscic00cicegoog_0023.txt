LIFE OF CICERO 11

as an unfortunate interruption of his favorite studies, he
resumed with pleasure his quiet student life, and for the
next five or six years we find him devoting himself untir- X
ingly to the preparation for that high position of useful-
ness and honor to which he was looking forward with so
much confidence. He determined that he would make
himself an orator and a statesman; that his voice should
be heard indefense of the right in courts of justice and in
the Forum. No sacrifice of time or labor would be too -
great if thereby he could achieve success Indeed, the
record of these years of preparation r'eminds us of the
remarkable accounts which have come down to us in
regard to the severe course of training and discipline to
which Demosthenes is said to have subjected himself in
preparing for the bema, where he achieved such-won-
derful success. Cicero, like Demosthenes had certain
defects to overcome. He accordingly labored untiringly
to cultivate his voice, to acquire graceful movements, and
to increase his physical strength, which was by no means
equal to the strain of the Forum. He studied the action
of the great leaders of the Roman stage, thus pressing
into his service the best lessons of the histrionic art. In
this part of his work the famous actors Aesop and Ros-
cius were his teachers and his models.

.⁶. His Favorite studies-Cicero, in accordance with his
theory of the extensive demands of the orator’s art, strove
, to compassio a general way all the departments of human
knowledge then known to the Roman world, but rhetoric,
logie, philosophy, and law were his favorite studies.
Rome was already beginning to be the home of Greek
culture and retinement, and abounded in learned teachers
who were ready to impart instruction in all the branches
