prospect of a complete reconciliation of parties, and that the state
needed his presence and counsel. Accordingly, abandoning his con-
templated visit to Greece‚ he hastened to Rome, where he arrived on
the thirty-first of August. But his expectations were again disappointed
Antony, whose power was still unchecked, had summoned the senate to
meet on the following day, to decree new honors to ,Caesar's memory.
Cicero excused himself from attending, on the ground os fatigue and ill
health; but Antony rose in his place and assailed the absent senator
with a tirade of abuse. On the following day the senate was again in
session, but Antony found it convenient to be absent. Cicero was pres·
ent, and, in the course of debate, delivered his First Philippic. lt was
a masterly effort. With calm dignity and perfect sels-possession, he
explained his own course, stated his views of the duties of the hour,
and exposed the ambitious designs of Antony.

Cicero delivered fourteen Philippics against Antony. Of these, four
were delivered during the last four months of the year 44 nc. and the
other ten during the first four months of 43 nc.

At the opening of the year 43 nc. Antony was at the head of his
legions in Cisalpine Gaul, which he hoped to wrest from Decimus Brutus,
to whom that province had been assigned by Caesar and the senate,
but about the twentieth of April the glad tidings reached Rome that
he had been defeated in a bloody battle by the consul Pansa. The
next day the senate met in the Temple of Jupiter, and Cicero roseln
his place and delivered the Fourteenth Philippic. A motion was before
the house that a thanksgiving should be decreed to the immortal gods
for their gracious intervention at this crisis in the history of the repub·
lic. He seconded the motion with the amendment that the number of
days should be increased to fifty, that the title of imperator should be
conferred upon the two consuls and upon Octavianus, who had espoused
the cause of the senate, and that a magnificent monument should be
erected to those who had fallen in the battle.
