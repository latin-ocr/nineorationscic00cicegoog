course, be ratified by the patrician senators and would thus
become a law.

3. The Roman constitution gave all criminals under sen-
tence of death the right to appeal to the people. All such
questions of appeal were decided by the centuriate assem-
bly under the presidency of the praetor; but the perma-
nent courts, established by Sulla, 81 Be, abolished the
death penalty, and thus put an end to these questions of
appeal.

135. Reform of the Centuriate Assembly. -About the
¹ middle of the third century nc, the centuriate assembly,
though still voting by centuries, was reorganized on the
basis of tribes, Under the new arrangement each of the
thirty-five tribes, into which the state was then divided, had
five classes of seniors and five of juniors‚ and each class
formed one century and cast one vote ; each tribe therefore
contained ten centuries and cast ten votes. Thus the thirty-
five tribes contained three hundred and fifty centuries; to
which must be added the eighteen centuries of knights and
the five additional centuries as before, making a grand total
of three hundred and seventy-three (3 50÷ 18÷ 5).

Noru.—Observe that in this organization wealth has lost the irn-
mense advantage which it had under the previous arrangement, as the
first class now has no more weight than the fifth. The only advantage
that wealth and age still retained isfound in the fact that the first class
was probably smaller than the others and the seniors fewer than the
Junrors

136. Decline of the Centuriate Assembly.- From this

time the influence of the centuriate assembly declined -

rapidly, in view of the growing importance of the comitia
tributa, which was gradually supplanting it. Still its exclu-
sive right to declare war was recognized.
