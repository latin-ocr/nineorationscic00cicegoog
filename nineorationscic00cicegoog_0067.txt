senate and to preside over its deliberations; to introduce

89. Proconsuls. —After the reforms of Sulla in the
year 81 13.c. the consuls were, in general, civil magistrates
during their term of office, but usually became provincial
governors the following year with the title of proconsuIS.

90. Lictors. — Each consul, when on duty, was attended
by twelve lictors with fasces‚2 which were the symbols of
the authority of the magistrate and of his right to inflict
punishment.

Nora—The fasceS‚ consisting of a bundle of rods in which an ax
was inserted, symbolized the right of the consul to order offenders to
be scourged and even executed3 but, after the Valerian law securcd to
every citizen under sentence of death the right of appeal to the peo-
ple‚ the ax was removed from the fasces
in the city, but retained in them in the

provinces.

91. Insignia.—The official insig-
nia of the consul, when in the city,
were the sella curulis and the toga
praetexta, a white toga with a pur-
ple or scarlet border. In the prov-
inces, as a military commander, he
assumed the paludamentum,³ a scarlet military cloak worn
over the armor.
