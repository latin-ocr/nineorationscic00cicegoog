7. Ad m01‘tem te (luci iam pridem oportebat ε long aga ought you ta leave
been put (led) ta death. Note the difference of idiom between Latin and
English in the use of tenses, which makes it'necessary to render the imperfect
oportebat by the present ought, and the present duci, hythe perfect ta tave
been led (put). Observe the force of the imperfect. H. 535, 15 LM. 7383

iussu consulis ε a decree called decretum ultimum had been passed by the

senate on the twenty-first of October3 this clothed the consuls with dictato· .

rial powers for the safety of the republic. Whether it gave the consuls
authority to put a citizen to death without a trial is an open question, and
was so to the Romans themselves 3 see 122.

P. Scipio: P. Scipio Nasica Serapio, consul in 138 nc. Ti. Gracchus,
tribune in 133 nc„ revived the Licinian laws which forbade citizens to hold
public lands in large amounts. Gracchus wished to be chosen tribune for
132 ΒΩ to complete his reforma but was attacked and killed hya mob of
senators headed by P. Scipio. Cicero seems here to approve the action of
Scipio, but it is'h'ecause he wishes to take similar action against Catiline. In
another speech, de Lege Agraria, he calls the Gracchi amantissimi plebis
Romani viri, and adds non sum autem is consul qui, ut plerique, nefas esse
arbitrer Gracchos laudare. In our passage, Cicero is speaking as a poli·
tician, quoting history as Satan does scripture.

10. mediocriter: in a moderate degree onht, as compared with the trea-
sonable plot of Catiline.

11. privatus: the office of pontifex maximus, being religious, was not a ma·
gistratus, hence its incumbent was a privatus lt is probable, however, that
Scipio did not, at the time referred to, hold the office of pontifex maximus.

orbem terrae: tlte circle as lands about the Mediterranean Sea; to the
Romans tlte whole world.
