isdem . . . auspiciis: with the same auspices witi which this city was

SECOND ORATION AGAINST Canama

Exordium, 1

Pago 105, line 1. Cnnrrnn 1.—Tandem aliquando: stronger than
tandem, now at lost.

Quirites: citizens. This term designates Roman citizens in their civil
capacity. Its derivation and literal meaning are uncertain.

in leis bold villony.

2. scelus anhelantem: i.e. his very breath oi life is wickedness.

3. vobis: H. 426, ²3 LM. 531 ; A. 3673 G. 346³ B. 187, II; (H.385,11).

4. vel eiecimus vel . . . vel: the orator speaks as ii feeling sor the right
word to designate the part which he has played in bringing about the depar-
tureos Catiline. Eicio is to drive away, emitto to allow to go, while ipsum
egredientem verbis prosequor, in irony, is not only to allow to go, but to
escort to the gate; see note on ut te prosequantur, p. 98, l. 4. Perhaps
verbis refers to the closing paragraph in the first oration,- Hisce ominibus,
etc.
