6. Quibus auspiciis: to understand Cicero’s meaning here we need to
keep in mind the Roman idea of the relation of the gods to human affairs.
The augur, though not himself a magistrate, was the one who interpreted the
auspices. No one but a magistrate could take the auspices, and no one could
enter upon office unless the auspices were properly taken. Cicero, as an
augur, would know perfectly well that he could not take the first step in such
a usurpation as the one with which he was charged. The passage also brings
out strongly the ultraconservatism of the Romans in all matters pertaining to
the formalities of religion. ΤῙκ meaning is then, - Under what auspices was
I,on augur, to receive those fasces? Hono long was Itohold the potuer? To
whom was Ito transmit it? Powers illegally gained could not be legally
transmitted to a successor. See 109, 116, 122.
