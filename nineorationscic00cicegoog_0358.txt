noa nonus

6. duobus in locis: ie. in Spain and in Asia.

disiunctissimis maximeque diversis: ie. in the East and in the West.

7. a binis copiis: bynna armies (forces). Why not duabus instead of
binis? Η- ι64,3; LM·1081;A·137.b; G·97‚R·3; B·8¹‚4; (H·174.2‚3)·

8. ancipiti: in two places.

de imperio: jin the very existence os tlte empire.

10. alterius partis . . . Hispaniensis: the danger from one quarter,
namely from Sertorius and Spain.

12. Pompei: the statement here is too favorable to Pompey. During four
years of war he had been twice defeated by Sertorius, but the assassination of
the latter by Perpenna enabled Pompey to bring the war to a close.

15· felicitati: indirect object of tribuenda esse.

haec extrema: these last events, ie. his recent reverses. Triarius, the legatus
of Lucullus, had been defeated with the loss of 7000 men, but this was when
Lucullus was absent.

16. fortunae: ta liis missortune.

17. alio loco: see Chapter 8 of this oration.

18. ei: H. 4273 LM. 5343 Α. 381 ; G. 3453 B. 188, 2, d; (H. 385, Il, 2).

20. quoniam is est exorsus orationis meae: since this (the dignity and
glory of Rome) is tlte first topic in my discussion, ie. of the general division
on the nature of the war3 is is attracted to agree with the predicate noun
exorsus. H. 396,2; A. 296,a; G. 211, u. 53 Β. 246, 53 (H. 445, 4).

Study the career of Sertorius and its political significance in the history of
the time.

²4· Cnaman 5.-iniuriosius: ratkerbadly. H.498; LM. 6783 A. 291,
a; G. 297, 23 B. 240, 13 (Η. 444, 1). The reference is perhaps to wars
with the Illyrian pirates. In another passage Cicero says, Quot bella maiores
nostros et quanta suscepisse arbitramini, quod cives Romani iniuria adjecti,
quod ›canicularii retenti, puori mercatores spoliati dicerentur?

tot milibus: how many are said to have been killed?

26. quo animo: ablative of characteristic.

Legati . . . appellati superbius: this seems a very mild statement of
the offense. The Roman ambassadors at Corinth, according to Polybius,
attempted to address the meeting of the Aehaean League, but were insulted
and driven from the assembly. The war which followed resulted in the
destruction of Corinth and the complete conquest of Greece hythe Romans,
in the year 146 nc. This war, however, is a good illustration of the eager·
ness with which the Romans seized upon any and every pretext for extending
the boundaries of their empire. .
