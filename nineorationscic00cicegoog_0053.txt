DELIVERY

DELIVERY

66· A Roman orator in the time oi Cicero needed to be
not only an inspiring writer, but also a graeelul and accom-
plished actor; a master, in fact, oi the histrionic art. It-
would be difficult to exaggerate the importance attached to
action in ancient oratory. Cicero calls it the eloquence
ol the body,l and he gives it the first place in speech2; he
says that, without appropriate action, the best oration ever
prepared would inevitably fail to move an audience‚ while
any ordinary speech delivered by a Roscius³ would elicit
the most enthusiastic applause. The testimony oi Demos-
thenes on this point is equally explicit3 he says that the
first and highest4 qualification oi a consummate orator is
action.

of all the varied parts oi man's nature. Inspiring emo-
tions, loity thoughts clothed in the choicest language, re-
quired to be delivered in the pleasing and harmonious tones
oi a cultivated voice, but with great earnestness, and with
all the accessoriesoi a vigorous but gracelul action. Thus
the proper delivery oi an oration in the senate or in the
Forum required that the look, the tone, the gesture, the
voice, the hand, the foot, and, in fine, the whole body, its
pose and movements, should all contribute harmoniously
to the desired effect.

was not only the first, but also the second and the third qualification lor the
