PRAErORs

92. The praetorship was established in 366 ne. to relieve
the consul from jurisdiction in civil suits. At first a single
praetor was elected annually by the comitia centuriata. He
was regarded as the colleague of the consuls and assumed
their duties at home when they were in the field. His
special duties, however, were those of a judicial magistrate,
but in dispensing justice he was usually assisted by iudicer,l
judges or jurors, selected originally from the senate.

93. Two Praetors.—After the year 242 ne. two prae-
tors were annually elected, a praetor urbanus, having charge
of civil suits between citizens, and a praetor peregrinus, hav-
ing charge oi suits in which the interests oi foreigners
were involved.

94. Inaugural Edicts. -On entering office the praetor
urbanus issued an edict announcing very definitely what
principles of law would govern him in his decisions, and
these various edicts, extending through centuries of court
practice, now serve as the basis of a large part ol our
code ol Roman law. The praetor peregrinus in like man·
ner issued similar decrees stating what principles would
govern him in considering the interests of foreignerS, and
the various edicts derived from this source are a valuable
contribution to international law.

Noun. —Until the time of Gaius Gracchus the privilege of furnishing
iudices to the Roman courts belonged exclusively to the senate3 Grac-
chus took it from the senate and bestowed it upon the knights, but Sulla,
81 13.c., restored it to the senate. ln 70 rae, however, still another change

¹ Under the judicial system of the Romans the iudex united in some meas·
ure the two offices ol judge and juror, as he was expected to render a verdict
in accordauce with the law and the testimony.
