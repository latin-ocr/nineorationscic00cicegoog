· sometimes gave judgment in person, and sometimes he

referred the decision to a single iudex, judge or juror,
selected from the senate. In suits involving the inter-
ests of foreigners the procedure, under the direction of
the praetor peregrinus, was the same,

2. In cases of great importance‚ civil or criminal, the
decision was referred to a special commission, consisting
of a large body of iudicer, created by a special law.
The number of iudices varied from time to time ; see 144.

3. Any citizen convicted of a capital crime was allowed to
appeal to the eoruitia centuriata, whose decision was final.

143. Quaestiones Perpetuae. —The earliest permanent
court was established by the lex Calpurnia, 149 nc, to try
provincial governors accused of extortion. It was called
quaestio perpetua de repetundis. A praetor presided, and
the iudices were senators

144. Judicial System under Sulla. —In the year 81 ac.
Sulla introduced a new judicial system, consisting of eight
distinct courtS, each to take cognizance of some particular
class of crimes. They were designated as follows: quaestio
perpetua de repetundis (extortion), a'e maiestate (treason),
· de vi (assault), de surcariis (murder), de ambitu (bribery),
de falsis (fraud), de petralata (embezzlement), de adulteriis
(adultery). In these courts, as organized by Sulla, the
iudices were all to be taken from the senate, but subse-
quently the Aurelian law, enacted in 70 Bc, provided that
one third of the iudr'ees should be senators, one third
knights, and one third tribuni aerarii.1 In these courts

1The history of the tribuni aerarii is somewhat obscure. It seems prob-
able‚ however, that they were originally linancial officers of the local tribes,

and that in wealth they ranked directly below the knights. The Aurelian

law seems to recognize them as forming a distinct order in the aristocracy of
wealth.
