by a certain Grattius, of whorn nothing further is known.

7. religione: not religion, but conscientiousness.

9. sed egisse: bul that he did it‚· egisse must not be taken too literally.
Lucullus did not confer the franchise on Archias, but his influence secured it
for him.

11. publico testimonio: official proos.

12. liic: under these circumstances, ie. although you have the most ample
proof.

tabulas publicas: the state records. Grattius denied that Archias was a
citizen of Heraclea, and challenged Cicero to prove it from the records of
that city. But, unfortunately, these records had been destroyed by fire dur·
ing the Social war.

13. Italico bellot ie. the Sociai, or Marsian war, 90-88 B.c.

16. litteratulus os the recorda, referring to tabulae publicas.

17. cum: concessive.

viti: ie. of Lucullus.

integerrimi municipii: i.e. Heraclea This city received the Roman
franchise and became a municipium under the Julian law in the year 90 ac.
It was previously a free city (civitas spederata) in alliance with Rome. Note
the force of integerrimi.

19. quaa idem dicis: which you yourself say : a remark which Grattius
seems to have made in regard to the records of Q. Metellus, as may be
inferred from the following chapter.

24. quae solae ex illa, etc.: which alone oslhc registration os that boare!
os praeterr retain tlrc authority of public recorda i.e. of all the records made at
that time by the different praetors‚ those of Metellus alone were trustworthy.

What rights and privileges were conferred upon Archias by the grant of
Roman citizenship? ·

26. Crimisa 5.-cum: temporal‚ musal, or concessive?

Appi tabulae: Cicero proceeds to contrast the records made by Metellus,
in which the name of Archias appears, with those made by his associates‚
Appius Claudius and P. Gabinius. Those of Appius were not properly taken
care of. Forgeries might have been introduced into them. The recklessness
of Gabinius, and his condemnation on the charge of extortion, destroyed the
value of bis register3 but the records of Metellus were executed and pre·
served with the most scrupulous care.

27. nuum diu incolumis tuit: i.e. before he was tried, in contrast with

post &montionem
