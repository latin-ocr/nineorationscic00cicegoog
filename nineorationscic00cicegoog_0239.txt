- INTRODUCTION

QUINTUS LIGARIUs, in whose behalf this interesting and beautiful
oration was delivered, had been a partisan of Pompey in the civil
War. '

ln the year 50 uc, Ligarius, who was then lieutenant under Gaius
Considius, governor of Africa, was left in charge of that province when
the governor himself returned to Rome to sue for the consulship. At
the opening of the Civil War,a few months later, he was importuned
by the friends of Pompey in Africa, to put himself at their head, and
thus secure the province for their party, but this he positively refused to
do. About this time, however, P. Attius Varus, who had commanded
for Pompey in Picenum, but had been deserted by his troops, arrived in
Africa and assumed the command. Ligarius readily consented to serve
under him, and thus united his fortunes with the cause of Pompey. He
was finally taken prisoner at Adrumetum, where his life was spared
through the clemency of Caesar, though he was not permitted to return
to Rome. An effort waS, however, soon after made by his friends to
secure his recall from exile, but Quintus Tubero. who had himself been
apartisan of Pompey, but had been pardoned by the Dictator, sought â€˜
to defeat this movement in his behalf by preferring a formal charge
against him as one who had borne arms in Africa against Caesar. ,
Cicero replied in defense, praying that the clemency which the Dictator
had shown to 'him and to Tubero might not be refused to Ligarius in
his misfortune and exile. The appeal was successful, and Ligarius was
pardoned, but he still remained implacable, and, two years after, became
one of the assassins of Caesar.
