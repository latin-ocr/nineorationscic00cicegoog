king was at first vested in the hands of two chief magis

trates, called praetors or consuls, but was subsequently dis-
tributed among a large number of magistrates with special
duties.

82. Republican magistrates. —The republican constitu-
tion as finally developed recognized the following magis-
tr'ates :—

1. Regular magistrates: the consul, praetor, censor,
aedile (plebeian and curule), quaestor, and tribune.

2. Occasional magistrates: the dictator, magister equi-
tum, and interrex.

Nora-All of these magistrates, except' the plebeian aedile, the
quaestor, and the tribune, were entitled to the use of an official state ἵ
chair, called sellu curulis (91), which was regarded as a symbol of
authority and majesty. They were, therefore, called curule magalo
tratas.

83. Ius Imaginum.—Among the special privileges of
the Roman nobility was the ius imaginum, the right of any
family to display in the atrium painted portraits in wax of
any of their ancestors who had held curule offices. Under
each portrait was an inscription giving the name and deeds
of the illustrious ancestor thus represented. These ima-
gines were most highly prized because they furnished
indubitable evidence of the nobility of the family to which
they belonged.

84. Magistrates with the Imperium. —The consul, prae-
tor, dictator, magister equitum, and interrex exercised the
supreme authority, called the imperinm, with which the
highest magistrates were clothed outside of the city.
Within the city the imperium of the consul and praetor
was subject to the tribunician veto and to an appeal to the
people in the centuriate assembly.
