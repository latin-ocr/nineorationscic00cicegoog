lNTRODUCTlON

ΟΝ the fifth of December the senate met in the Temple of Concord,
- to decide the fate of the prisoners. D. Junius Silanus consul elect,
recommended the punishment of death, but C. Julius Caesar, praetor
elect, objected to capital punishment as illegal, and recommended irn-
prisonment for life. lt was in the course of this debate that Cicero
pronounced his Fourtlt Oratzbn against Catilina. The sentence of
death was decreed by the senate, and executed that very night, under
the direction of the consul himself.

ln the meantime, Catiline was in Etruria, at the head of a formidable
force, where, in the ensuing spring, he was defeated in a desperate con·
test, and tell in the thickest of the light.
