PREFACE

Tun volume now offered to the public is intended to be
emphatically a student’s edition of the orations most frequently
read in a Latin course preparatory for college. The orations
which it contains are all fine specimens of Roman eloquence,
and they illustrate the forensic, senatorial, and judicial depart-

ments oi Roman oratory. They are arranged in the order in Α

which, it is thought, they can be studied to best advantage.
Before the text of each oration is placed a special introduction,
intended to furnish the pupil with such ihformation in regard
to the occasion and the subject as the orator assumes to be
already in the possession oi his hearers The principa] rhetoriss
cal divisions of the orations are designated by the technical
Latin terms usually employed by the ancient rhetoricians.

The text is that ol C. F. W. Mueller, Leipzig, 1895 and 1896.
Long vowels are marked in the first five orations only, as it is
deemed important for the student of Cicero to have some prac-
tice in reading Latin without such aid.

The notes are intended to aid and guide the efforts of the

student who has already had some experience in the reading ,

of a Latin classic and is now just beginning the study of Roman
oratory‚ a subject intimately connected with the public life of
the RomanS, and one which the student ought to find not only
highly instructive, but deeply interesting. They aim, therefore,
to give him the key to all really difficult passages, and at the
same time to iurnish him such collateral information upon
Roman manners and customs, upon Roman history and life,
as will enable him to understand, appreciate, and enjoy these
