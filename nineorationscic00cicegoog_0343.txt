7. hoc auctore et cognitore: witlr bin as tte author and advocate.

8. illam alteram: tltat other opinion, that of Silanus,

9. nescio an . . . contrahatur: Iam inclined to tbink more trouble may
be brought upon me. Η. 650, 4; LM. 8143 A. 331, n.; G. 457, ²3 B. 300, 53
(H- ⁵29. r, n. ε).

10. meorum . . . rationes: tte consideration os my dangers.

11. vincat: let outweiglr.

12. maiorum eius :¹ the Julian gens, to which Caesar belonged, was oue of
the oldest and most famous in Rome. In the Aeneid it is traced back to
Iulus, theson of Aeneas.

13. Intellectum eet: it roos percetoed, ie. as he spoke.

15. saluti populi consulentem: these words are added to define the term
vere popularem. The learner must not fail to notice the different senses in

which popularis is used. Coming as it does from populus, its primary signifi·

cationis belonging to, or relatr'ng to, tlte people. With this general meaning it ¹

has three principal applications: 1. Belonging to the party of the people, a
political application ; 2. Devoted to the interests of the people; 3. Having
the favor of the people, popular in the usual sense of the term. Caesar
belonged politically to the party of the people ς the term popularis was,
therefore, applicable to him in the first sense, and Cicero here pays him the
flattering compliment of applying it to him in the second sense.

16. uon neminem: some one or more. Some critics think it probable that
Cicero here referred especially to Q. Metellus Nepos, tribune-elect, whose veto
prevented him from presenting the 'usual report at the close of his term of
office as consul. On non nemiuem, see H. 656, 1; LM. 675 ; Α. 326, a;
G·449‚ 4; (H· 553, 1)-

17. de capite: questions which thus involved the life or civil status of e
Roman citizen could be tried only in the Comitia Centuriata. The senate
therefore had no legal right to condemn the conspirators to death.

18. Is: referring to non neminem. .

nudius tertius: also written as one word, = nunc dies tertius, tbe day before
yesterday.

19. mihis in my bonor, dative of reference.

ιο. Iam: noro, i.e. in view of these facts, marking a connection of thought,
not mere time.

hoc: tlris, explained by the indirect question quid . . . iudicarit.

21. qui: be mbo. The omitted antecedent of qui is the subiect of iudica·
rit. The meaning of this sentence is that every one clearly sees what judgment
has been given in the ease by those who have favored the dccrcer already
passed in the senate.
