TECHNICAL nonus 43

refutatio, refutation, intended to answer any objections that
may be raised against the position taken by the
speaker.

peroratio, the conclusion, usually prepared with special
care. This may, oi course, take various forms,
according to the needs oi the occasion, and it may
embrace one or all oi the following subjects:—

1. enumeratio, a brief recapitulation oi the leading
arguments in an impressive and attractive form.

2. indignatio, an indignant protest against the position ’
taken by the opponent.

3. conquestio, a pathetic appeal to the sympathies of
those with whom rests the decision oi the case.

69. Although these various terms are used by Roman
rhetoricians in treating of eloquence, it must not be sup·
posed that Cicero's orations conform in every particular
to the general outline here given. In lact, most oi them
omit one or more oi these six divisionS, and in some
instances an hortatio, an earnest exhortation‚ or a deprecatio,
an appeal to the court, takes the place of one oi them..
Thus the First Oration against Catiline contains aprapa·
sitia, a narratio, an lrartatia, and aperaratia,· the oration
ior Ligarius, an exordium, a narratio, a confirmatio, a depre-
catia, and a peroratio. The oration ior the Manilian law is
our best illustration oi a finished deliberative oration.¹
