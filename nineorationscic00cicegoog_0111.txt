FIRST ORATION AGAINST CATILINE 87

of his agents at once promised to call upon the consul the next morn-
ing and assassiuate him in his own house3 but Cicero, iorewarued iu
regard to their purpose, refused to admit them.

On the eighth oi November, the senate met in the Temple oi Jupiter
Stator, which was guarded by Roman knights. Catiline, contrary to
the expectation of all, had the effrontery to present himself at the meet-
ing, but no greeting welcomed him to his accustomed place3 the seats
in his vicinity were instantly vaoeted3 the traitor sat alone, an object os
scorn and contempt. It was then that Cicero, the consul, giving utter-
ance to his indignation in a torrent of invective, pronounced his First
Orattan against Catilinae.

Yon ltere, Catilina, in all your andacity Ι l'onr plans ore
known ,· your crimes deseror death.

1. Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostri?
Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet? Quem ad
finem sese effrenata iactabit audacia? Nihilne te noctur-
num praesidium Palati, nihil urbis vigiliae, nihil timor
populi, nihil concursus bonorum omnium, nihil hic munitis· 5
simus habendi senatus locus, nihil horum ora vultusque
moverunt? Patere tua consilia non sentis? Constrictam
iam horum omnium scientia} teneri coniurationem tuam non
vides? Quid proxima, quid superiore nocte egeris, ubi
tueris, quos convocaveris, quid consilii ceperis, quem nos-10
trum ignorare arbitraris? ’
