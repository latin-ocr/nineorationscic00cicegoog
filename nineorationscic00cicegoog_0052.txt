elected consul at the age of lorty-four. He was then at
the height of his fame, but he was destined soon to find
alormidable rival in Cicero, who, though eight years his
junior, was already beginning to be recognized as the fore-
most orator ol Rome. Fortunately, however, the relation
between these two eminent orators never assumed the
form ol a bitter rivalry, but rather that of a friendly emu-

lation. For many years we find them laboring side by
- side in the senate, at the bar,and in the Forum. They
were the two best representatives ol the two styles of
oratory then recognized at Rome: Hortensius ol the
Asiatic style,l which delighted in ornamentation and gave
more attention to language and delivery than to thought3
Cicero, of the Attic style,l which aimcd to unite strength
and beauty in due proportion.

65. Three Kinds of Eloquence.—Roman rhetoricians rec-
ognize three kinds of eloquence,—the Judicial (genus
¹ iudiciale) for courts of justice, the Deliberative (genus
deliberativum) for the senate and the popular assembly,
and the Demonstrative (genus demonstrativum) for eulogy
and invective. The orations in this volume illustrate these
three kinds of eloquence, though no one of themis purely
demonstrative. Those [or Archias and Ligarius may ¹be
classed as judicial and all the rest as deliberative; but the
praises ol Pompey in the oration for the Manilian law, of
Caesar in the orations for Marcellus and Ligarius, and of the
generals and soldiers in the fourteenth Philippic, together
with the invective against Catiline and Antonius, illustrate
the general characteristics of the genus demonstrativum.

1 Quintilian says that to speak in the Attio style is to speak in the best style,
and Professor Jebb says that Attio oratory was an art founded upon a theory;
Asiatic, a knack founded upon practice.
