TRIBUNES

106. The tribunate, a plebeian office, was established in
494 nc. to protect the plebeians The number ol tribunes
probably two at first,l was increased to four in 471 nc. and
to ten in 457 ac. They were always elected by plebeians,
and always by the plebeian tribal assembly, the comilium
plebis, after the organization oi that body in 471 rac.

107. Duties ot 'hibunes—From the first it was the
duty of the tribunes to protect the plebeians against any
arbitrary action on the part oi magistrates. They were
accordingly vested with a power of veto, which enabled
them effectuallyto arrest the action of any magistrate.
To enable them to exercise this power with safety‚ their
persons were declared sacred, and they were clothed with
authority to inflict summary punishment, even death itself,
upon any one who violated the sanctity of their persons ,
They were without the imperium, and they had no official
insignia, but they ultimately gained the right to convoke
the senate and to submit bills forits consideration and
action. They presided over all the meetings oi the plebe-
ian tribal assembly2 which gradually gained power and
influence until finally its decisions acquired the full force of
laws. Under Sulla a plebiscitum required the preliminary
approval of the patriciau senators, but even this restrictiori
was soon removed. Indeed, under the efficient manage-
ment ot the tribunes, the plebeians succeeded iu the course
oi the fourth century rac. in gaining admission to the con-
sulship and all the other magistracies.

108. Tribunician Veto—In the senate the tribunician
