FIRST ORATlON AGAINST CATILINE N21

Pergamo, line 2.-Ao huius vitae studium: sor tkepursuttossuch a lise.
meditati sunt: ore desr'gmd. The.passive force of this verb is confined

to the gerundive and the perfect participle, as in the case of many deponents.
qui feruntur: which ore reported.

3. iacere, vigilare: in apposition with labores.

4. insidiantem: agrees with te, the omitted subiect of vigilare3 insi-
diantem somno maritorum illustrares ad obsidendum stuprum, and insidi-
antem bonis otiosorum illustrares ad facinus obeundum.

6. Habes ubi ostentes: you hove an opportunity to show, lit. where you
may show; clause of characteristic with the relative adverb uhi.

7. quibus: refers to tamis, trigoris, inopiae.

9. ut posses: substantive clause of result in appositiou with Tantum.

exsul, consul: in apposition with the omitted subject of posses. Note the
play upon words, frequent in Cicero.

10. esset susceptum: subjunctive because the clause is closely connected
with the antecedent and is necessary to explain it. H. 6523 LM. 793; Α
soor &663³ B·3²4; (ΗΙ 529, 11)-

How do you account for the doubled letter in reppuli? Cf. the similar
forms repperi, rettuli, reccidi, and the form of the perfect in the simple verb.

Peroratio, 11-13

13. Crimina 11.-llunc‚ patres conscripti: Cicero now addresses the
senate. Itis not likely that this elaborate justification of his course was
actually a part of the impromptu speech which Cicero delivered before the
senate. It was probably added by him when, as Sallust, Cot. 31, tells us, he
afterward wrote out and published his speech.

ut a me detester ac deprecer: root I moy ooert from myselfoy proles! ond
entreoty. Note here the original middle force of these deponents; detestari,
to avert from one's self by testimony3 deprecari, to avert from one’s self by
prayer.

15. quaeso, old form of quaero, chiefly used parenthetically, as in this
instance.

16. Etenim: this properly belongs to the conclusion of this conditional
sentence, but as the condition with the quotation which it contains extends to
the end of the chapter, the conclusion is made an independent sentence at
the beginning of the next chapter: His . . . respondebo Thus we have
here an instance of the figure anacoluthon.

si patria . . . loquatur: this personifieation of the country, calling upon
her servant Cicero to give an account of himself, has been greatly admired.
