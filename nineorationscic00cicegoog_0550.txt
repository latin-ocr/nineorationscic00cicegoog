HIS WORK ir preiminently a student's edition of Caesar's Commentaries
Ton the Gallie War, and has been prepared with special reference to the

present needs of preparatory and recondary schools. While itis remark-
able forits simplicity, yet it contains everything which is needed for studying the
author. Attention is called particularly to the following special features of the
book:

1. This edltlorr is fumished with an Introduction containing an outline
of the life of Caesar, a description in brief of the soenes of his military operations
in Gaul, Germany, and Britain, and a short treatise on the military system
⁴ of the Romans, together witha list of valuable works on subjecta treated in the
Introduction.

2. 'l'he text is chiefly that of the critical edition of H. Meusel, Berlin, ’
1894, now quite generally accepted as the standard. Each important chapter
begins witha brief summary in English.

3. The notet are intended to guidc the faithful efforts of the student and
to interest him in the stirring events recorded in the Commentarios. Special atten-
tion has been given to the difficolt subjecte of the subjunctive mood and of the
indirect discourse.

4. The vocabulum gives special attention to etymology, but the treat-
ment is made as simple aa possible with the sole aim of aiding the student in
understanding and appreciating the significant elementa of words. The important
subject of idioms and phrases receives due attention.

6. The illustratione are entirely appropriate and unlike those in most
other works of a similar nature. They have in no instance been introduced merely
for purposes of decoration. Among the most striking features of the work are the
nine colored plates illustrative of the military system of the Romans, which have
been made only after consultation with the highest authorities, and are here repro-
duced in their natural colors. Besides these, there are many other illustrations,
eleven plana of battles, seven' campaign maps, and a general map of Gaul.
