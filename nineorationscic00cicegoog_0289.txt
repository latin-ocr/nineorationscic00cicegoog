FIRST ORATION AGAINST CATILINE N 17 .

clearly the supreme effrontery of Catiline, that he went successively to Lepi·
dus, an err-consul, to Cicero, the consul, and to Metellus, the praetor, asking
them to take him into free custodyq

2. ad Μ’. Lepidum: ut the house os Munius Lepidus. Τ1κε usual preposi-
tion in this sense is apud. Manius Lepidus was consul with Volcatius Tullus
in 6611.ο.; see p. 93,l 29.

4. (lomi mue: observe that meae in agreement with domi is in the
locative case.

5. rne nullo . . . contineremur: in apposition with responsum.

isdem parietibus, in tlte same house (lit. house walls), locative ablative;
isdem moenibus, by the same city natu, ablative of means.

6. quiessem: causat.

7. Q. Metellum: Quintus Metellus Celer is meant. He subsequently took
an active part in the military operations against Catiline3 cf. p. 107, l. 3, and
Sall. Cat. 30 and 57. He was consul in 60110.

8. virum optimum: ironical.

9. 11. Metellum: a friend of Catiline.

quem tu videlicet . . . putasti: the irony of this statement is manifest.

11. Quam longe videtur abesse debere: a personal construction, but to
be rendered impersonally, how sar does it seem thar lte ought to be? The sub·
ject of videtur is the omitted antecedent of qui.

¹3· custodia: H. 4813 LM.654; A· 418, b; G. 397, u. 2 3 Β. 226, 2;
(H. 421, ΙΙΙ).

14. emori: to die, as justice demands.

expression for the action of the consul in laying a subject before the senate.

expressionin legislation. What is the subject of placere?

decreverit: perfect subjunctive for future perfect indicative of the direct
discourse.

19. requos abhorret a meis moribus: a course which would be (is) in-
consistent with my character. Perhaps Cicero means to imply that he is too
merciful, that if the question were referred to the senate a decree of banish-
ment would be passed, whereas without such reference Catiline may go into
voluntary exile. The real reason for his refusal, however, doubtless was that
the senate had no right to pass such a decree.

20. faciam ut intellegas: I will make clear to you ,· ut intellegas is an
object clause with helam.
